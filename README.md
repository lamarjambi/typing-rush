Silly, confusing typing game :3 

___
Inspired by the Saudi card-game, Lakhma (Confusion) 
You need to scream your answer out loud when playing Lakhma, which makes it funny :P

screen = start, default (title + manual)
screen = game, type FONT COLOR! it gets confusing :P
screen = game-over, if you get > 3 mistakes, GAME OVER!! (you can retry :3)
screen = end-game, YAY YOU WON!!

*Have fun!*
